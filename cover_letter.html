      <p class="salutation">Dear Mr. Kelly,</p>
      <p class="letter">I'm excited to apply to be a part of the Portland Code School JavaScript Immersion class.  I've enjoyed the challenging environment of the Web Development Primer this month.  I appreciate the collaborative approach to learning, as well as the encouragement for us to learn new techniques on our own, and advance our own understanding of the topics.</p>
      <p class="letter">I have spent the last 8 years as a police officer, and the last 6 of those as a major crimes detective.  I was the lead case officer on 4 murder investigations, and worked hundreds of other cases including attempted murders, robberies, assaults, thefts, fraud, and other cases.  Prior to my police experience, I was an Army Officer for 4 years.  In that capacity, I served two combat tours: one in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and one in Iraq.  My role in both of these was as the supervisor of up to 100 soldiers tasked with protecting the perimeter of the forward operations bases where we were stationed.</p>
      <p class="letter">I'm excited to begin this class and continue my education in web development.  From my military and police careers, I have learned how to solve complex problems in a fast-paced and shifting environment; I have learned how to make the most of team structures so that every member contributes to the solution; and I have learned to pay attention to how the smallest details affect the resolution of even the largest problems.  I look forward to bringing these skills to bear in furthering my education in current web technologies.</p>
      <p class="closing">Sincerely,<br><img src="signature_image.png" alt="Signature"><br>Dmitry White</p>
